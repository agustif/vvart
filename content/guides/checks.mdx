<h4>Checks is a digital art collection created by Jack Butcher in January 2023.</h4>

{" "}

<p>
Checks offers commentary on what it means to be **verified** in the age of the
internet, as social media companies seek to sell users blue check marks as a
means to confirm their authenticity.
</p>

{" "}

<p>
This monetization model comes with many challenges, including, and not limited
to a wave of accounts **impersonating others** ~ thereby diluting the value of
this once coveted blue check mark, calling into question the notability of any
account which displays this blue badge.
</p>

<Tweet id="1623502995311718400" />

<p>
The short comings of this top down approach to confirm users authenticity on
the internet comes in stark contrast to the successful bottoms up approach we
have seen flourish in Web3.
</p>

<p>Today, in Web3 users have the luxury of being able to take for granted the ease at which we can authenticate the origins of any action on chain such as who created, who collected, who sold, who transferred an NFT ~ simply by ***checking the chain***.</p>

### What is Visualize Value?

Visualize Value is a modern education company designed to provide people with the frameworks and information they need to "maximize opportunity in the age of the internet."


Visualize Value was co-founded by Jack & Cecilia Butcher in January 2019.

A very key component of the Visualize Value coursework are the stunningly simplistic visuals Jack creates to illustrate important points, such as the popular example below.

<Image width={680} height={382} src="/images/guides/checks/vv-this-is-pointless.png" alt="Visualize Value - This is pointless" />
At the **request** of his followers, Jack began minting these illustrations as NFTs in 2021, auctioning them on [foundation.app](http://foundation.app) ~ with the following iconic illustration selling for a cool 74 ETH in March 2021 ~ over $110,000 at the time.

Today, Jack Butcher is widely regarded as one of the most ***successful digital artists*** in modern history with Checks & Opepen continuously captivating collectors from all around the world.

## How did Checks begin
<Accordion title="How did Checks begin" slug="how-did-checks-begin" readingTimeInMinutes={3}>
<article className="prose">

Checks began as an open edition mint whereby collectors determined the quantity created.

It cost collectors $8 to mint a Check ~ a play on the cost users now pay to purchase a blue check mark to prove their authenticity on Twitter (now X) in 2023 <Icons.logo className="inline-block h-4 w-4" />


This mint lasted for 24 hours ~ in total, collectors minted 16,027 Checks as seen below ⬇️

<Image width={680} height={680} src="/images/guides/checks/checks-art.png" alt="Visualize Value - This is pointless" />

Based on this very strong response, Jack, the creator of Checks [**took to Twitter**](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1611726527590187016?s=20) to share a potential path whereby collectors could burn their Checks and receive new generative artwork.

While the 24 hour window to mint Checks occurred on the 3rd of January, this transparency thread Jack shared over the course of a week marked the moment Checks would go on to become one of the most popular digital art collections created in 2023.

For a detailed breakdown of the thought process behind this decision to turn Checks into a generative art collection, we highly recommend reading Jacks “[***transparency time thread***](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1611726527590187016?s=20)”

## What are Checks editions
<Accordion title="What are Checks editions" readingTimeInMinutes={2}>
<article className="prose">
<h4>Checks began as a collection of 16,027 tokens with identical artwork.</h4>

<p>When the new mechanics for Checks were released in early February, the original 16,027 Checks tokens became Checks editions ~ Checks editions are best described as an <strong>unrevealed</strong> Checks</p>

<p>Checks collectors have the agency to reveal a Checks edition anytime via the <a href="https://burn.checks.art/migrate">Checks website</a>.</p>

<p>When a collectors reveals a Checks edition, this token become a Checks original.</p>

<p>To date, collectors have revealed a total of 10,458 Checks</p>
<p>~ 65% of the collection <Icons.logo className="inline-block h-6 w-6" /></p>

## What are Checks originals
<Accordion title="What are Checks originals" readingTimeInMinutes={2}>
<article className="prose">

When a collector reveals a Checks edition, they receive a Checks original.

### What’s the **difference** between these two tokens?

Checks editions tokens all share the same artwork.

The artwork attached to Checks editions has been changed many times ~ the artwork for Checks originals cannot be changed as the Checks Originals artwork is fully on chain.

Additionally, the artwork for Checks originals are all unique.
### What’s the value of having this artwork on chain?

Having the Checks originals artwork on chain removes any external dependencies such as AWS going down as the Checks originals artwork is generated from the Checks smart contract.

{/* ## A guide to revealing Checks */}
<Accordion title="A guide to revealing Checks" readingTimeInMinutes={4}>
<article className="prose">


Checks can be revealed on the official Checks website.

A number of factors determine how revealed Checks (Checks originals) look.

### 1) Color band
#### Revealed Checks have seven possible color bands:
<div className="text-center text-3xl font-bold">
(1 / 5 / 10 / 20 / 40 / 60 / 80)
</div>
The lower the color band, the higher the concentration of a specific color, with 1 band Checks containing a single color, and 80 band Checks containing 80 different colored Checks.

- The odds of revealing the different color band(s) *********(Incomplete)***


- 1 band = 1/60
- 5 band =
- 10 band =
- 20 band =
- 40 band =
- 60 band =
- 80 band =

### 2) Gradient
#### ~ Revealed Checks have six possible gradients.

When revealing Checks, collectors have a 20% chance of revealing a Check with a gradient.

What exactly is a gradient?

As seen below, a gradient influences how the color is structured on the canvas.

- A ***breakdown*** on the odds to reveal each gradient: *********(Incomplete)***


- No gradient =
- Linear gradient =
- Angled gradient =
- Linear Z gradient =
- Reflected gradient =
- Double Linear band =

### 3) Speed of Motion
#### ~ The Checks artwork contains movement

Revealed Checks have 3 possible speeds.

The speed of a Checks motion determines how fast the Checks change color.

- 0.5x speed Checks change color the slowest
- 1x speed Checks change color the 2nd fastest
- 2x speed Checks change color the fastest of all

To view the motion Checks contain, simply click on the Check on OpenSea.

        Checks allows collectors to become creators.

        <h3>How do you create new Checks?</h3>

        When a collector reveals a Check, the Check contains 80 check marks on the canvas.

        Collectors can create new Checks by merging two x 80 Checks to create a 40 Check, two x 40 Checks to create a 20 Check ~ all the way down to a canvas that contains a single Check.

        Collectors can use <a href="http://checks.art">checks.art</a> to create these new Checks.

        <Image src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/2018f1a9-c191-44c6-9fdc-5f7da002eb91/rounded_corners__70_.jpg" alt="rounded_corners__70_.jpg" />

        <h3>What determines the color of a new Check?</h3>

        The color(s) of the original Checks determine the color of the new Check.

        Collectors also have the choice on which Checks token ID they would like to keep.

        <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/5b2a9e6c-aaa3-41c5-8f8c-17188ce37983/rounded_corners_-_2023-07-29T032300.712.png" alt="rounded_corners - 2023-07-29T032300.712.png" />

        <h3>How do you retain gradients when creating new Checks?</h3>

        Checks can retain the gradient of the original Check, however, only 1/5 Checks will be a successfully match for a Check to retain its gradient.

        To preview possible combinations, collectors can use: <a href="http://Previewchecks.art">previewchecks.art</a>

        This tool was created by a Checks community member (<a href="https://twitter.com/curtisjcummings">Curtis J Cummings</a>) and it allows collectors to preview the output of combing any two Checks by entering their unique token ID.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="A guide to creating single Checks" minTimeReading="2">
      <article>
        It requires 64 x 80 Checks to create a single Check, to date 40 single Checks have been created.

        Single Checks come in 80 different possible colors ~ the following are the colors of the 40 single Checks collectors have created to date.

        <h3>How many single Checks can be created?</h3>

        With a total of 16,027 Checks ~ it’s possible for collection to create up to 250 single Checks.

        Last, but no least, Checks collectors can create a “Black Check” ~ this creation requires 64 single Checks (4096 Checks originals), to date 0 out of a possible 3 Black Checks have been created.

      </article>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What is the Black Check" minTimeReading="4">
      <article>
        The Black Check requires 4,064 Checks originals.

        With less than 500 Checks listed across all marketplaces today ~ the Checks community is in complete control of the creation of a Black Check, a piece of digital art that can only be created should the Checks community reach a consensus to consolidate their Checks.

        This is a perfect demonstration of decentralized consensus ~ a foundational feature in the the bottoms up approach we have seen flourish in Web3 to authenticate on chain actions.

        <h3>Example of decentralized consensus:</h3>
        <p>We collectively agree <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x34eebee6942d8def3c125458d1a86e0a897fd6f9">this is the Checks smart contract</a> as we collectively agree that this smart contract was released from <a href="https://opensea.io/visualizevalue/created">Jack Butchers wallet.</a></p>

        Reaching a decentralized consensus has been one of the key ideas Checks has explored since the collection inception in January 2023.
