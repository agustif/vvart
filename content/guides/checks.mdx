#### Checks is a digital art collection created by Jack Butcher in January 2023.




Checks offers commentary on what it means to be **verified** in the age of the
internet, as social media companies seek to sell users blue check marks as a
means to confirm their authenticity.


{" "}


This monetization model comes with many challenges, including, and not limited
to a wave of accounts **impersonating others** ~ thereby diluting the value of
this once coveted blue check mark, calling into question the notability of any
account which displays this blue badge.

### Top Down vs Bottoms Up

The short comings of this ***top down*** approach where social media companies struggle to confirm users authenticity on the internet comes in stark contrast to the successful bottoms up approach we have seen flourish in Web3.


Today, in Web3 users have the luxury of being able to take for granted the
 ease at which we can authenticate the origins of any action on chain such as
 who created, who collected, who sold, who transferred an NFT ~ simply by
 ***checking the chain***.

Visualize Value is a modern education company designed to provide people with the frameworks and information they need to "maximize opportunity in the age of the internet."


[Visualize Value](https://visualizevalue.com) was co-founded by **Jack & Cecilia Butcher** in January 2019.

A key component of the Visualize Value educational coursework are the stunningly simplistic visuals Jack Butcher creates to ***illustrate important points***, such as the popular example below.

<Image width={680} height={382} className="rounded-lg" src="/images/guides/checks/vv-this-is-pointless.png" alt="Visualize Value - This is pointless" />
At the request of his followers, Jack began minting these illustrations as NFTs in 2021, auctioning them on [foundation.app](http://foundation.app) ~ with [the following iconic illustration](https://foundation.app/@visualizevalue/foundation/25193) selling for a cool 74 ETH in March 2021 ~ $110,000+ at the time.

Today, Jack Butcher is widely regarded as one of the most ***successful digital artists*** in modern history with **Checks** & **Opepen** continuously captivating collectors from all around the world.

## How did Checks begin
<Accordion title="How did Checks begin" slug="how-did-checks-begin" readingTimeInMinutes={3}>
<article className="prose">

#### Checks began as an open edition mint whereby collectors determined the quantity of Checks created

It cost collectors $8 to mint a Check ~ a deliberate play on the cost users are now required pay to purchase a blue check mark to prove their authenticity on Twitter in 2023 <Icons.logo className="inline-block h-4 w-4" />


This mint lasted for 24 hours, with collectors minting **16,027** identical Checks as seen in the image below <Icons.arrowDown className="mx-auto" />

<Image width={680} height={680} className="rounded-lg" src="/images/guides/checks/checks.jpeg" alt="Visualize Value - This is pointless" />

### What Happened Next?

Based on collectors strong response to the original Checks artwork, Jack Butcher, the creator of Checks [**took to Twitter**](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1611726527590187016?s=20)  to share a pathway for each of the 16,027 identical Checks to become a unique piece of generative artwork.

The 24 hour window to mint Checks occurred on the 3rd of January 2023 ~ this transparency thread Jack shared over the course of many days marked the moment Checks would go on to become one of the most popular digital art collections.

For a detailed breakdown of the thought process behind this decision to turn Checks into a generative art collection, we highly recommend reading Jacks [***transparency time thread***](https://twitter.com/jackbutcher/status/1611726527590187016?s=20)

## What are Checks editions
<Accordion title="What are Checks editions" readingTimeInMinutes={2}>
<article className="prose">
#### Checks began as a collection of 16,027 tokens with [identical](https://x.com/jackbutcher/status/1611726527590187016) artwork.

When the new mechanics for Checks were released in early February, the original **16,027** Checks tokens became Checks editions ~ Checks editions are best described as an ***unrevealed*** Checks.

### How do holders reveal Checks?

Checks collectors have the agency to reveal a Checks edition anytime via the
 [Checks website](https://burn.checks.art/migrate)

When a collectors reveals a Checks edition, this token become a Checks original.

To date, collectors have revealed **10,500+** Checks ~ more than 65% of the entire collection  <Icons.logo className="inline-block h-6 w-6" />

## What are Checks originals
<Accordion title="What are Checks originals" readingTimeInMinutes={2}>
<article className="prose">

When a collector reveals a Checks edition, they receive a Checks original token.
### What’s the difference between these two tokens?

Whereas Checks editions all share the same artwork, each of the Checks original tokens contain a unique piece of generative artwork.

Additionally, Jack Butcher has updated the metadata to change the artwork attached to the Checks editions tokens many times, whereas the artwork for Checks originals tokens cannot be changed as the artwork for Checks Originals tokens are generated via immutable on chain data.

### What’s the value of having this artwork on chain?

Having the Checks originals artwork on chain removes any external dependencies for Checks.

In the majority of cases, digital art collections store the images attached to their tokens on servers such Amazon Web Services, or Google Cloud.

Whereas AWS going down would negatively impact these collections, the Checks originals artwork is generated from the Checks smart contract ~ removing any external dependencies.

## A guide to revealing Checks

<Accordion title="A guide to revealing Checks" readingTimeInMinutes={4}>
<article className="prose">

Checks can be revealed on the official Checks website.

A number of factors determine how revealed (Checks originals) look.

### 1) Color band
#### Revealed Checks have seven possible color bands:
<div className="text-center text-3xl font-bold">
(1 / 5 / 10 / 20 / 40 / 60 / 80)
</div>
The lower the color band, the higher the concentration of specific colors, with 1 band Checks containing a single color, and 80 band Checks containing 80 different colored Checks.

![Originals have seven possible color bands](/images/guides/checks/color-bands.jpeg)


##### The odds of revealing the different color band(s)

- 1 band = 1.67%
- 5 band = 2.5%
- 10 band = 5%
- 20 band = 8.33%
- 40 band = 16.67
- 60 band = 33.33%
- 80 band = 32.5%

![color band distribution visualzation detail](/images/guides/checks/color-bands-detail.png)

### 2) Gradient
#### ~ Revealed Checks have six possible gradients.

When revealing Checks, collectors have a 20% chance of revealing a Check with a gradient.

What exactly is a gradient?

As seen below, a gradient influences how the color is structured on the canvas.

- A ***breakdown*** on the odds to reveal each gradient: *********(Incomplete)***


- No gradient =
- Linear gradient =
- Angled gradient =
- Linear Z gradient =
- Reflected gradient =
- Double Linear band =

![Originals have six possible gradients](/images/guides/checks/gradient-checks.jpeg)

### 3) Speed of Motion
#### ~ The Checks artwork contains movement

Revealed Checks have 3 possible speeds.

The speed of a Checks motion determines how fast the Checks change color.

- 0.5x speed Checks change color the slowest
- 1x speed Checks change color the 2nd fastest
- 2x speed Checks change color the fastest of all

To view the motion Checks contain, simply click on the Check on OpenSea.

        Checks allows collectors to become creators.

        <h3>How do you create new Checks?</h3>

        When a collector reveals a Check, the Check contains 80 check marks on the canvas.

        Collectors can create new Checks by merging two x 80 Checks to create a 40 Check, two x 40 Checks to create a 20 Check ~ all the way down to a canvas that contains a single Check.

        Collectors can use <a href="http://checks.art">checks.art</a> to create these new Checks.

        <Image src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/2018f1a9-c191-44c6-9fdc-5f7da002eb91/rounded_corners__70_.jpg" alt="rounded_corners__70_.jpg" />

        <h3>What determines the color of a new Check?</h3>

        The color(s) of the original Checks determine the color of the new Check.

        Collectors also have the choice on which Checks token ID they would like to keep.

        <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/5b2a9e6c-aaa3-41c5-8f8c-17188ce37983/rounded_corners_-_2023-07-29T032300.712.png" alt="rounded_corners - 2023-07-29T032300.712.png" />

        <h3>How do you retain gradients when creating new Checks?</h3>

        Checks can retain the gradient of the original Check, however, only 1/5 Checks will be a successfully match for a Check to retain its gradient.

        To preview possible combinations, collectors can use: <a href="http://Previewchecks.art">previewchecks.art</a>

        This tool was created by a Checks community member (<a href="https://twitter.com/curtisjcummings">Curtis J Cummings</a>) and it allows collectors to preview the output of combing any two Checks by entering their unique token ID.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="A guide to creating single Checks" minTimeReading="2">
      <article>
        It requires 64 x 80 Checks to create a single Check, to date 40 single Checks have been created.

        Single Checks come in 80 different possible colors ~ the following are the colors of the 40 single Checks collectors have created to date.

        <h3>How many single Checks can be created?</h3>

        With a total of 16,027 Checks ~ it’s possible for collection to create up to 250 single Checks.

        Last, but no least, Checks collectors can create a “Black Check” ~ this creation requires 64 single Checks (4096 Checks originals), to date 0 out of a possible 3 Black Checks have been created.

      </article>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What is the Black Check" minTimeReading="4">
      <article>
        The Black Check requires 4,064 Checks originals.

        With less than 500 Checks listed across all marketplaces today ~ the Checks community is in complete control of the creation of a Black Check, a piece of digital art that can only be created should the Checks community reach a consensus to consolidate their Checks.

        This is a perfect demonstration of decentralized consensus ~ a foundational feature in the the bottoms up approach we have seen flourish in Web3 to authenticate on chain actions.

        <h3>Example of decentralized consensus:</h3>
        We collectively agree <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x34eebee6942d8def3c125458d1a86e0a897fd6f9">this is the Checks smart contract</a> as we collectively agree that this smart contract was released from <a href="https://opensea.io/visualizevalue/created">Jack Butchers wallet.</a>

        Reaching a decentralized consensus has been one of the key ideas Checks has explored since the collection inception in January 2023.
